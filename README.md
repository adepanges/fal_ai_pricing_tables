# üß† fal.ai Model Pricing Table

A public, community-maintained table of pricing data for models available on [fal.ai](https://fal.ai). Useful for developers, researchers, and AI builders who want to compare and calculate costs before using a model.

## üìä What‚Äôs Inside

This repository contains:
- A `fal_models` table schema (PostgreSQL)
- Clean tabular and structured data exports
- Utilities for filtering and comparing models based on:
  - Unit price
  - Use case (e.g., Text-to-Speech, Image-to-Video)
  - Commercial-use allowance
